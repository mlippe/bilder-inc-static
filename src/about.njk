                <h4>Why</h4>
                <p>
                  The state of personal photography today is in an interesting situation: technology has evolved rapidly in the last two
                  decades.<br><br>
                  But still personal photo collections tend to be rather cluttered, which makes it complicated to find and access our
                  photos.<br><br>This is really sad, because there are so many memories getting lost in digital and physical space.

              <div class="about-description-item">
                <h4>What</h4>
                <p>
                  I wanted to give personal photography a new home, a space that lives up to the value our photos have to us.<br><br> This
                  space mainly focuses on a centralised storage for all your photos. Furthermore it promotes the actual consumption of the
                  images, to bring people back to all those good moments they had in their lifes.<br><br>
                  And of course, in todays connected society, it elevates the sharing of photos with your friends and family.

                <p>
                  Bilder Inc. is the ecosystem for personal photos.<br><br>
                  BilderBox is the central space for your photos as well as the
                  Bilder system: it houses all companion devices as well as powerful hardware to run advanced software functionalities.<br><br>
                  BilderAI automatically sorts and organizes your photo library. BilderApps make your photo collection accessible
                  anywhere, on all major plattforms.<br><br>
                  BilderBook allows you to flip through your memories just like it used to be in the good old times.<br><br> BilderBeam provides a large canvas to view photos in a picture night with your friends and loved ones.<br><br>
                  BilderScan is a super fast and easy way to bring your paper photos into the digital space. Quickly scan prints or
                  negatives with the dedicated scanner units.

            <p>Some selected results of my research I have done for this project. First I conducted an online survey about personal
              photography with a total of 115 participants. Secondly I interviewed 18 persons from different age groups, cultures and
              genders about this topic.<br><br> The graphs shown here are an aggregation of this data.</p>
