                <h4>Why</h4>
                <p>
                  Modern personal photography is at a crossroads due to its rapid evolution in the last two decades.<br><br>
                  Nevertheless,
                  personal photo collections tend to be rather cluttered, which makes it complicated to find and access our photos.<br><br>This is really sad because so many memories fall through the cracks between the digital and physical space.

              </div>
              <div class="about-description-item">
                <h4>What</h4>
                <p>
                  I wanted to give personal photography new home that lives up to the personal value we place on our photos.<br><br> This
                  new home entails a centralized storage system for all your photos. Furthermore it enhances the actual consumption and
                  enjoyment to remind one of their precious memories accumulated through a lifetime.<br><br>
                  Lastly, this new home for photos allows one to stay connected to friend and family through an elevated sharing
                  mechanism.

            <p>Some selected results of my research I have done for this project. First I conducted an online survey about personal
              photography with a total of 115 participants. Secondly I interviewed 18 persons from different age groups, cultures and
              genders about this topic.<br><br> The graphs shown here are an aggregation of this data.</p>
